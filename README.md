# NCAA-March-Madness
This repository includes the scripts and files used to predict the outcomes of the NCAA Tournament as part of the [Kaggle compeition here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania-2017).



Below are the blog posts to the winners from the last 2 March Machine Learning Mania competitions hosted by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

* [2015 Winner](http://blog.kaggle.com/2015/04/17/predicting-march-madness-1st-place-finisher-zach-bradshaw/)

* [2016 Winner](http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/05/10/march-machine-learning-mania-2016-winners-interview-1st-place-miguel-alomar/)


## Random Forest Model
The RandomForest_Predictions.R file was my first attempt at formatting the data and creating a random forest model to predict the outcome of the tournament games. I'll add more details to this file and potentially a codebook with more information soon.


## Seed and Elo Benchmarks
There are a couple useful script available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) that compute predictions based on [tournament seeds](https://www.kaggle.com/wacaxx/march-machine-learning-mania-2016/seed-benchmark-data-table-in-r/code) and [team Elo ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/wacaxx/march-machine-learning-mania-2016/elo-benchmark-playerratings-in-r). These scripts might be useful to generate comparison predictions for the final model.
